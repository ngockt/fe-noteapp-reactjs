Design a webpage in html that displays a hierarchical content structure with the following levels:  
**Domain > Field > Branch > Subject > Topic > Concept**

## Features to Include:
1. **Search Bar**: 
   - A search bar to search across the hierarchy.
   - Include real-time suggestions as the user types.

2. **Filter Bar**: 
   - Place a filter bar above the search bar with buttons for each content type (e.g., All, Domain, Field, etc.).
   - The filter buttons should control the visible content and adapt the suggestions accordingly.

3. **Responsive Layout**: 
   - Ensure no elements overlap and maintain a clean, responsive design.

4. **Interactive Hierarchy**: 
   - Allow users to toggle the visibility of nested content by clicking on parent items.

5. **Dynamic Suggestions**: 
   - The suggestions list should dynamically adapt to the selected filter type.

6. **Spacing and Layout**:
   - Maintain consistent spacing between the filter bar, search bar, and hierarchy content for an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

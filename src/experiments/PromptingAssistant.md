Create a modern, production-ready React component using the following best practices:

1. Use **functional components** with React Hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) instead of class-based components.
2. Write clean, readable, and maintainable code with proper props and state.
3. Ensure the component adheres to **accessibility (a11y)** guidelines where applicable (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
4. Include **prop validation** with  fallback default props.
5. Use **Bootstrap 5** for styling and layout while adhering to React-Bootstrap best practices (e.g., using `react-bootstrap` components and avoiding inline styles when possible).
6. Follow best practices for **state management** (e.g., lifting state up, passing callbacks for events).
7. Ensure responsiveness using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and utilities.
8. Write unit-test-ready code with clear separation of concerns.
9. Add comments where necessary for clarity.
